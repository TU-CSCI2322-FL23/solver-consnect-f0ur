--Column number (inputed by player when making move)
--Only storing colors in holes; not storing empty holes
-- 7 Columns by default
-- Head of column is highest color in stack
--     - when we drop a new color, it gets appended to the front of the list
--Don't need to index bc we can use  splitat

-- We don't derive Show because we have a custom one!

-- 0 to 6 (makes it easier to code; we can change it to 1 to 7 later)
